# Model Attribution and Methodology Transparency

Our predictive analytics models for talent retention and workforce forecasting are based on methodologies and frameworks published by leading workforce analytics organizations, including:
- U.S. Bureau of Labor Statistics (BLS)

All modeling and analysis is performed in-house using our own data and code. No proprietary data or report content is used. Model structures and risk factors are adapted from industry-standard predictive analytics frameworks, ensuring our solutions are both credible and original.

We are committed to transparency and best practices in predictive analytics. For more information about our modeling approach or to request technical documentation, please contact our team or visit the Predictive Analytics Landing Page.
